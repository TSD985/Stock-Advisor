## 💹 Stock Advisor Agent – UiPath-Powered Real-Time Stock Insight Automation

### 📘 Overview
**Stock Advisor Agent** is an intelligent **RPA-based automation** developed using **UiPath Studio Web**.  
It automates the process of fetching live stock data directly through **web search**, extracting relevant details, and providing summarized insights — enabling faster, more informed investment decisions without manual effort.

### ⚙️ How It Works

#### (1) User Input
The user enters the **name or symbol** of the stock they want to analyze.

#### (2) Automated Web Search
The bot performs a **live web search** using the provided stock name to fetch up-to-date market details such as **current price, percentage change, and recent performance indicators.**

#### (3) Data Analysis
Using logical conditions and pre-defined evaluation rules, the automation analyzes how the stock is performing.

#### (4) Recommendation & Reasoning
Based on the fetched data, **UiPath Agents** generate a clear recommendation:  
- **Buy:** If the stock shows consistent growth or positive trend.  
- **Avoid:** If the stock reflects loss, high volatility, or negative trends.  

Each suggestion includes a short **reasoning statement** (e.g., “The stock has shown a 2.3% rise today with stable volume — suitable for buying.”)

#### (5) Output Delivery
The result and reasoning are displayed directly in **UiPath Agent's Output Panel**.
